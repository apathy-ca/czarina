# Project Memory: Czarina Multi-Agent Orchestration System

## Architectural Core

### Component Dependencies
<!-- Document critical component relationships and load order here -->
<!-- Example: AuthContext must mount before any component making authenticated API calls -->

### Known Couplings
<!-- Document explicit and implicit couplings discovered through development -->
<!-- Example: UI re-renders can race with token refresh → auth failures -->

### Constraints
<!-- Document critical constraints that must not be violated -->
<!-- Example: All API calls through /api prefix for proxy routing -->

### Technology Stack
<!-- Document key technologies, frameworks, and patterns in use -->
<!-- Example: Bash orchestration, Python workers, git worktrees, tmux sessions -->
