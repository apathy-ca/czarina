    "getting_started": "GitHub Copilot can work with Czarina workflows through VS Code. Open the worker file and use Copilot Chat to ask it to read and follow the task instructions. Copilot Chat (@workspace feature) can reference the worker file context.",

      "Use Copilot Chat with @workspace to include worker file in context",
      "Open the worker file first, then ask Copilot to 'read this file and follow the instructions'",
      "For git operations, use the Source Control panel or terminal with gh CLI",
