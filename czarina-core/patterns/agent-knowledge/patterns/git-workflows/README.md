# Git Workflow Patterns

**Purpose**: Specific git workflow patterns and battle-tested examples for AI-assisted development.

**Status**: To be populated with patterns from agentic-dev-patterns repository.

## Overview

This directory will contain specific git workflow patterns, examples, and strategies that complement the general git workflow rules defined in core-rules.

## Relationship to Core Rules

**Core Rules** define the standards and requirements (the "what"):
- [Git Workflow (Core Rules)](../../core-rules/workflows/GIT_WORKFLOW.md) - General workflow rules and standards
- [PR Requirements](../../core-rules/workflows/PR_REQUIREMENTS.md) - Pull request review criteria
- [Documentation Workflow](../../core-rules/workflows/DOCUMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md) - Documentation synchronization

**Patterns** show specific strategies and examples (the "how"):
- Branch Strategies - Specific branching patterns for different scenarios
- Commit Patterns - Commit message examples and templates
- PR Workflow Examples - Step-by-step PR creation and review examples
- Multi-Agent Coordination - Patterns for coordinating git work across multiple agents

## Planned Content

The following patterns are planned for this directory:

### Branch Strategies
- Feature branch workflows
- Release branch patterns
- Hotfix workflows
- Worker branch coordination (Czarina orchestration)

### Commit Patterns
- Conventional commit examples
- Multi-file commit strategies
- Documentation sync patterns
- Atomic commit guidelines

### PR Workflow Patterns
- PR creation templates
- Review checklist examples
- Merge strategies
- Conflict resolution patterns

### Multi-Agent Git Patterns
- Branch isolation strategies
- Integration workflows
- Code review coordination
- Merge conflict prevention

## Contributing

When adding patterns to this directory:
1. Ensure they are based on real experience (not theory)
2. Include concrete examples
3. Explain the rationale and benefits
4. Cross-reference to relevant core rules
5. Show both good and bad examples where applicable
