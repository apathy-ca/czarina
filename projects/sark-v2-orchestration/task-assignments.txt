COORDINATION NOTES:
- ENGINEER-1 is code review gatekeeper - all PRs need their approval
- QA-1 and QA-2 should report test results daily
- DOCS team should track engineer PRs and update docs accordingly
- All work should be in feature branches, NOT main
- Target: 2-3 PRs approved and merged per day

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. ENGINEER-1 (Phase 2 MCP Adapter - blocks future work)
2. QA-1 & QA-2 (Validate all completed work)
3. DOCS-2 (Tutorials needed for users)
4. ENGINEER-6 (Migration testing critical)
5. ENGINEER-2,3,4,5 (PR creation and review)

Remember: "In an ideal world, I'm not here at all"
Work autonomously, coordinate via git commits, ask questions when blocked.
