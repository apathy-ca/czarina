### Created in This Session

1. **Complete Documentation** (12 major docs)
   - README.md (beautiful main page)
   - AGENT_TYPES.md (mix Claude, Aider, Cursor, humans!)
   - WORKER_PATTERNS.md (3, 6, or 12+ workers)
   - DISTRIBUTED_WORKERS.md (SSH to remote builds)
   - LESSONS_LEARNED.md (real-world insights)
   - IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md (v2.0+ roadmap)
   - CZARINA_SUMMARY.md (the complete picture)
   - V2_QUICK_WINS.md (what we built today)
   - WHATS_NEW.md (user-friendly guide)
   - CZAR_GUIDE.md (how the Czar works)
   - GETTING_STARTED.md (quick start)
   - WSL_GUIDE.md (Windows/WSL setup)

2. **Core System** (11 scripts)
   - czar-autonomous.sh (autonomous monitoring loop)
   - inject-task.sh (reliable task delivery)
   - update-worker-status.sh (status tracking)
   - detect-idle-workers.sh (idle detection)
   - detect-stuck-workers.sh (stuck detection)
   - dashboard.py (live dashboard)
   - pr-manager.sh (PR orchestration)
   - orchestrator.sh (interactive control)
   - launch-worker.sh (worker launcher)
   - QUICKSTART.sh (one-command start)
   - validate.sh (config validation)

3. **Configuration**
   - config.example.sh (template with best practices)
   - .gitignore (proper ignores)
   - LICENSE (MIT)

4. **Deployment Options**

## Your Feedback Shaped This

### Insight 1: "Any number, no?"
**Impact**: Changed from "6 workers" to "2-20+ workers"
**Added**: Complete worker patterns guide

### Insight 2: "Branches should identify what they're working on (v1.1)"
**Impact**: Best practices for branch naming
**Added**: Version-prefix patterns and examples

### Insight 3: "SSH to remote locations?"
**Impact**: Entire distributed workers design
**Added**: Complete technical design doc

### Insight 4: "Workers don't have to be Claude Code?"
**Impact**: GAME CHANGER - agent-agnostic platform
**Added**: Complete agent types guide, marketing pivot

## The Positioning

**From**: "Claude Code orchestrator"
**To**: "Universal multi-agent orchestrator"

**From**: "6 parallel workers"
**To**: "2-20+ workers, any agent type"

**From**: "Monitoring tool"
**To**: "Autonomous orchestration platform"

**Key differentiator**: Agent-agnostic + autonomous + battle-tested
